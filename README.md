## Fork & Signals

### Question 1

Outputs:

* 32040 - This is a possible output. 
* 34002 - N
* 30402 - Y
* 23040 - Y
* 40302 - N

As long as 30 is printed before 40, the output is possible. The 2 can be pretty much anywhere. 


### Question 2

Answers:

**Part I**

* 1 - 10 times
* 2 - The value is 1
* 3 - The value is 2

**Part II**

counter = 1

counter = 3

counter = 3

**Part III**

* 1 - No, it is different
* 2 - counter = 1,2,3,4,5 (1 is also possible - this would happen if all child processes termintated before the control was returned to the parent process; when the parent process runs the handler, the value is incremented to 1 and then no more child processes would terminate to cause the handler to run again) 

### Question 3

Output:

Hello
0
1
Bye
2

OR

Hello

0
Bye
2
